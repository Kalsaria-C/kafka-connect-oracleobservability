# Kafka to OCI Log Analytics hackathon runbook

## Target and roles

- Tenancy and compartment: supply your deployment values in `config/oci-sink.local.json`.
- Demo region: **Phoenix / us-phoenix-1**; change it for your deployment.
- Namespace and log group OCID: replace the placeholders in your local configuration.
- Example source: **Kafka Application Logs**. Example parser: **Kafka JSON Parser**.
- Developer owns connector code, chunking/retries and packaging. The tester owns the local setup,
  generator runs, LA parser/source verification, event reconciliation and demonstration.
- Keep credentials, environment identifiers and deployment notes in Git-ignored local files.
- No live OCI upload was performed by this build.

## 1 Start Kafka and the FileStream baseline

Use the official Kafka 4.1.2 Docker broker, retain its container/storage throughout the demo,
and run Connect from the matching Kafka distribution on the host. Kafka must advertise a host-reachable
listener at `localhost:9092`. Create topic `la-hackathon-logs` with one partition and replication factor 1.
Use Kafka console producer/consumer to check transport first.

Copy `config/connect-distributed.properties` to a local file and replace its absolute plugin path.
Install Kafka's connect-file plugin in its own directory beneath that path; it may not be enabled on the default worker classpath.
Keep the FileStream and Oracle Observability plugin directories separate. Start Connect with:

```sh
"$KAFKA_HOME/bin/connect-distributed.sh" config/connect-distributed.local.properties
curl --fail http://localhost:8083/connector-plugins
```

Set a real absolute output file in a local copy of `config/file-sink.json`. Register it:

```sh
curl --fail-with-body -X POST http://localhost:8083/connectors \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' --data-binary @config/file-sink.local.json
python3 scripts/generate_logs.py --count 100 --run-id file-baseline \
  | "$KAFKA_HOME/bin/kafka-console-producer.sh" \
      --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --topic la-hackathon-logs
curl --fail http://localhost:8083/connectors/oci-la-hackathon/status
```

Confirm all 100 unique IDs in the output file. Stop Connect, publish another run, restart and verify backlog delivery.
Keep the Kafka broker and internal Connect topics intact. This stage proves Kafka transport and recovery, not LA parsing.

## 2 Verify the LA source and parser before switching

1. Confirm profile access to your region and the namespace copied from LA Service Details.
2. Create or verify a dedicated log group in your destination compartment; copy its OCID into the local config.
3. Open **Kafka JSON Parser**, confirm JSON root `$`, and run Parser Test.
4. Open **Kafka Application Logs**, confirm type **File**, and verify that it uses that parser.
5. If the UI requires an entity type, select an appropriate host type. Initially omit entity ID/type from payloads.
6. Configure one fixed log set only if the tenancy requires it.

| JSON path | LA field | Type |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `$.timestamp` | `Time` | Timestamp |
| `$.message` | `Message` | String |
| `$.demo_run_id` | `Run ID` | String |
| `$.event_id` | `Event ID` | String |
| `$.service` | `Service` | String |
| `$.level` | `Access Level` | String |
| `$.latency_ms` | `Latency` | Float |

The table shows example mappings using Oracle-defined fields.
Recommended Console correction: map `$.level` to **Severity** instead of **Access Level**, which represents permissions.
This correction has not been made by the connector; confirm it in Console before filtering the error-spike run.
`Latency` accepts the generated numeric values; values from `latency_ms` represent **milliseconds**, with no conversion.
String fields can normalize case; inspect actual indexed severity values before filtering.
Verify UTC timestamp parsing, not just ingestion-time fallback.
Use fresh logs from the generator and wrap them with a JSON serializer:

```python
import json
records = [line.rstrip("\n") for line in open("sample.jsonl", encoding="utf-8")]
payload = {"logEvents": [{"logSourceName": "Kafka Application Logs",
                          "logPath": "kafka-hackathon.log", "logRecords": records}]}
with open("sample-logevents.json", "w", encoding="utf-8") as out:
    json.dump(payload, out, ensure_ascii=False)
```

Upload that envelope with `UploadLogEventsFile` using `payloadType=JSON`, the verified namespace/log group,
and the agreed OCI profile. `logGroupId` and optional `logSet` belong in request parameters.
Verify all ten sample IDs in Log Explorer, correct source/group, exact message, parsed time and numeric latency.
HTTP 200 alone confirms acceptance; later parsing and indexing must also succeed.

## 3 Install the custom plugin and switch configuration

Build with `mvn clean verify`, extract the plugin ZIP beneath `plugin.path`, and restart Connect.
Check that `/connector-plugins` lists `com.oracle.observability.kafka.connect.OracleObservabilitySinkConnector`.
Copy `config/oci-sink.json` to `config/oci-sink.local.json` and fill in the absolute OCI config path and profile.
Replace namespace and group OCID placeholders and set the exact source API name for your deployment.
If a local copy already exists, preserve its destination values and credentials settings. Local JSON configs are git-ignored.

To update an existing FileStream connector, PUT only the `config` object (not the POST wrapper):

```sh
python3 -c 'import json; print(json.dumps(json.load(open("config/oci-sink.local.json"))["config"]))' \
  > /tmp/oci-la-hackathon-config.json
curl --fail-with-body -X PUT http://localhost:8083/connectors/oci-la-hackathon/config \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' --data-binary @/tmp/oci-la-hackathon-config.json
curl --fail http://localhost:8083/connectors/oci-la-hackathon/status
```

FileStream already committed its records. Generate a **new run** after the switch; old records will not automatically replay into LA.
Use a separate connector/group for deliberate historical replay. Keep secrets out of the JSON and logs.

## HTTP proxy for the OCI client

If the worker needs an HTTP proxy for OCI egress, add these settings to the inner `config` object in your local JSON:

```json
"oci.proxy.host": "proxy.example.com",
"oci.proxy.port": "80"
```

Use a hostname only, without `http://`, port, path or credentials. This initial proxy support is unauthenticated.
The setting applies only to the OCI SDK client; Kafka broker connections are unaffected.
A blank or absent host leaves SDK routing unchanged. Do not assume shell `https_proxy` or `no_proxy` variables
configure this SDK client. An explicit proxy host sends this client's requests through that proxy.
Rebuild and reinstall the full plugin ZIP, restart the worker, then apply the updated connector config.
Keep corporate proxy hostnames and other deployment values in Git-ignored local files.

An unsigned HEAD request to the OCI service root can return 404 after successful TLS; this checks network reachability,
not upload authorization. If curl works only through a proxy while Java reports status -1, configure the OCI proxy
and inspect the DEBUG error message. Java and curl use separate certificate trust stores.

## Upload response debug logging

After installing the rebuilt plugin and restarting the worker, enable response metadata logging on that worker:

```sh
curl --fail-with-body -X PUT \
  http://localhost:8083/admin/loggers/com.oracle.observability.kafka.connect.OciSdkLogEventsUploader \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' --data '{"level":"DEBUG"}'
```

Each successful chunk emits `Log Events upload response` with the HTTP status, `opcRequestId`,
`opcObjectId` and `timeCreated` from the OCI SDK response. Optional response values may be null.
With DEBUG enabled, `Log Events HTTP response` also reports status and response headers for both success and failure.
Diagnostic header values are retained for `opc-request-id`, `opc-object-id`, `time-created`, `date`,
`content-type`, `content-length`, `content-encoding`, `retry-after`, `server` and `connection`.
Other header values, including cookies and authorization, are redacted. Output is bounded to 32 header names,
four values per header and 1024 characters per value; control characters are removed.
`Log Events upload failed` reports the SDK service code and sanitized error message, request ID,
HTTP-response availability, client-side/timeout flags, record/byte counts and elapsed milliseconds.
Transport failures may have no HTTP response or headers. Null SDK responses are reported separately.
Common credential forms and messages containing serialized LogEvents payloads are redacted; arbitrary error
messages can still contain service-supplied operational details, so enable DEBUG only while diagnosing failures.
Raw response bodies, request payloads and exception stack traces are not dumped by this diagnostic logger.
This is one response per chunk, not one per individual record. Retry and offset handling are unchanged.
HTTP 200 confirms API acceptance; check Log Explorer separately for parsing and indexing.
The runtime logger setting must be applied again after a worker restart; apply it to each worker that runs the task.
To restore normal logging, repeat the request with `{"level":"INFO"}`.

## 4 Exercise batching and byte chunking

Count limit demonstration (small logs, requests of at most 100 records; poll boundaries may produce smaller requests):

```sh
python3 scripts/generate_logs.py --count 250 --run-id count-demo \
  | "$KAFKA_HOME/bin/kafka-console-producer.sh" \
      --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --topic la-hackathon-logs
```

Byte limit demonstration (larger individual logs; byte cap should be reached before count 100):

```sh
python3 scripts/generate_logs.py --count 250 --run-id byte-demo --message-bytes 16000 \
  | "$KAFKA_HOME/bin/kafka-console-producer.sh" \
      --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --topic la-hackathon-logs
```

Use a fresh run ID each time. Observe accepted records, bytes and latency in Connect logs.
Run small/medium/large datasets of 1, 100 and 1000 records; test quotes, Unicode and embedded multiline strings.
In LA reconcile produced count, unique event IDs, total records, duplicates, missing IDs and indexing delay.
Use manual Log Explorer filters; saved searches and dashboards are deferred.

## 5 Recovery and presentation

Stop Connect while Kafka stays running. Publish 100 new logs and restart with the same connector name and internal state.
Require all unique IDs to appear; replay duplicates can occur. Mock HTTP tests separately prove handling of 429/503.
Check invalid credentials/destination behavior with the mock/local tests before any live negative test.
Do not interpret connector RUNNING or HTTP 200 as proof of correct LA field extraction.

For a five-minute demo: explain the flow, briefly show the FileStream baseline/config switch, send a fresh normal run,
show parsed LA records, send an error spike and filter ERROR, then demonstrate backlog recovery. Allow for measured indexing delay.
Save a successful recording and clearly identify it if used as a fallback.

## Completion gate

- Direct API upload and source/parser preview pass.
- 100 fresh connector-generated IDs are visible and correctly parsed in LA.
- Count and byte chunking produce complete requests within the cap.
- Restart recovery has no missing unique IDs; duplicates are documented.
- Shreyam can repeat the flow from this runbook without changing connector code.
